# Psst... Hey there!
### Can you fit size 10.5 shoes?
Looks like you're settling down great at your new job here in Ricky Corporation. But not all is as it seems!

I've got a job for you if you're willing to listen, kiddo.

I've infiltrated the upper echelon of the company and I may have my hands on incriminating evidence.
The Boss only trusts high ranking supervisors with the important ledgers that can prove criminal activity,
but after the ledgers have been "cleaned," they're sent to Accounting for processing.

The next cleaning date should be tomrrow, so we're going to need to extract the evidence before they wipe it clean!

Our cybersec guy, Ricky, got offed last week while trying to get access to an Accounting employee's account. Luckily, he got in, but now we don't have an expert who can extract the data!

You've come highly recommended to us, and we're out of options at this point.
